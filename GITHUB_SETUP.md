# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `Restaurant-System`
3. Description: `Complete restaurant ordering system with RBAC, real-time tracking, and advanced management features`
4. Set to **Public** (or Private if preferred)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Local Repository
After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
cd /home/srijan1001/Rest
git remote add origin https://github.com/srijan10011/Restaurant-System.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you want to use a different repository name, replace `Restaurant-System` with your preferred name in the commands above.
